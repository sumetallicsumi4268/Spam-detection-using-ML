Objective

To build a machine learning–based phishing detection system that can automatically classify messages as phishing or legitimate using natural language processing techniques.

Key Features

Text-based phishing detection using language models

Automated feature extraction from email or message content

Binary classification: Phishing vs. Legitimate

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Scalable pipeline for real-world datasets

Technologies Used

Python

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

TF-IDF / Language Model features

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

Methodology

Data Collection

Use labeled datasets containing phishing and legitimate messages.

Text Preprocessing

Tokenization

Stop-word removal

Lowercasing

Cleaning special characters

Feature Extraction

Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF or language model embeddings.

Model Training

Train a classification model to distinguish phishing from legitimate messages.

Evaluation

Measure performance using standard classification metrics.

Results

Achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset.

Successfully identified common phishing patterns such as:

Urgent language

Suspicious links

Requests for sensitive information

Applications

Email spam and phishing filters

Enterprise security systems

Messaging platform protection

Browser security extensions

Future Improvements

Integration with deep learning language models (BERT, GPT-based classifiers)

Real-time phishing detection system

Multilingual phishing detection

Web-based deployment
